# Heart-Disease-Classification

This is a machine learning classification project to find if the patient have heart disease or not.

The original data came from the [Cleveland database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Howevever, we've downloaded it in a formatted way from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset).

The original database contains 76 attributes, but here only 14 attributes will be used. 
Attributes (also called features) are the variables what we'll use to predict our target variable.

In this case, the independent variables are a patients different medical attributes and the dependent variable is whether or not they have heart disease.
